# Resume-Analyzer
This code implements a resume analysis tool that uses NLP to assess how well resumes match a job description. It preprocesses text, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and calculates cosine similarity scores to rank resumes by relevance. A Gradio interface allows users to input multiple resumes and a job description, providing clear similarity rankings.
